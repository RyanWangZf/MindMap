# MindMap: Knowledge Graph Prompting Sparks Graph of Thoughts in Large Language Models
This is the official codebase of the **MindMap** :snowflake: framework for eliciting the graph-of-thoughts reasoning capability in LLMs, proposed in [MindMap: Knowledge Graph Prompting Sparks Graph of Thoughts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09729.pdf).

# Overview
We present **MindMap**, a plug-and-play prompting approach, which enables LLMs to comprehend graphical inputs to build their own mind map that supports evidence-grounded generation. Here is an overview of our model architecture:
